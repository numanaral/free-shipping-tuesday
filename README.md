## Tips and Tricks:
- Use private / incognito browsing option to avoid having things cached between accounts.
	- Use the regular browsing first so you can save your credentials and you don't have to type this info in the future
- Prepare your shipping labels early to avoid dealing with overloaded servers on Tuesdays.
	- Lots of people will be creating free shipping labels and this creates an overload in the CP servers. You may come across errors such as:
		- Slow page.
		- Blank page.
		- Messed up styles on the page.
		- Things not properly functioning.
	- You can wait and try again later when there is less load.
		- You can also do it as soon as it's the midnight.
- Multi accounts.
	- You can have multiple business accounts.
	- There is no hard limit but please don't abuse it too much.
- Max dimensions & weight.
	- You can prepare the labels early as long as you know the other party's address.
	- You can enter the max dimensions and weight even if the package won't be as big and heavy as lister here. It's okay to over-estimate but it is NOT okay to under-estimate.
